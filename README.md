Cellular Morphological Features Improve Prediction of Cytotoxicity- and Proliferation-Related Assay Endpoints when Augmented with Molecular Fingerprints

This repository contains code on leveraging cellular morphological features to predict cytotoxicity- and proliferation-related endpoints from ToxCast

Five types of descriptors:
01_CP_ 
02_Erg_
03_Erg_CP_
04_Morgan_
05_Morgan_CP_

Two types of evaluation
cluster
singlematrix (aggregated) 

Endpoints are either:
Assays 'hit' call endpoints or combined endpoint
